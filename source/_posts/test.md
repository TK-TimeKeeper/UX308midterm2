The start of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) started in the late 1970s when the Disco genre was slowing down in popularity. While disco was slowly decreasing in popularity, house/electronic music was on the rise. So much so that it broke off into a bunch of different genres including EDM. Now EDM is a 6.2 billion dollar industry with fans all across the world.
